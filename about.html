    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <div>Hi! I'm Nikita Mandle, a passionate and driven student currently studying Computer Technology at Nagpur University. 
        My academic journey is fueled by a deep curiosity and enthusiasm for front-end and back-end development, which I've been exploring through my 
        coursework, projects, and extracurricular activities.</div>
<br>
    <div>I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn something new. 
        Whether it's diving into a complex problem, collaborating on group projects, or taking the lead on a creative initiative,
         I'm committed to developing my skills and making the most of every opportunity.</div>
<br>
    <div>Outside of academics, I enjoy indoor and outdoor game, which help me stay balanced and 
        bring fresh perspectives to my studies. I'm particularly passionate about cooking, 
        and I'm excited to pursue a career in Full Stack Development.</div>
<br>
    <div>Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I've worked on and the progress I've made in my academic and personal development. 
        I'm always open to connecting with others who share similar interests or who have opportunities for collaboration.</div>
